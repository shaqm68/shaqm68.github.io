        <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Comfort in Prospect
          Since I was young I have always been a very athletic person and one of the places where I played was Prospect Park. It was an athletic outlet. With enormous grass fields where people could play any sport or just relax and enjoy themselves. A feeling of excitement always came when I arrived at these grass fields. But, after a while I grew out of baseball and enjoyed soccer more and more. Ever since I was young I have always enjoyed soccer. One of my first experiences with organized play was at Prospect Park, The Parade Grounds specifically. The trashy turf has and will always be so nostalgic to me. Gaining my confidence in the sport was quite hard but the sense of familiarity I got from playing at The Parade Grounds made that easier. I first played in a “for fun” league called AYSO until I was about 10. I started to gain interest in joining a travel team the next step up. So I tried out and got onto a team called Gjoa. Again the try outs were at Prospect Park and that made me comfortable being in an environment I was used to. Feeling the same trashy turf under my feet relaxing under those big trees that created comforting shadows to hide from the glaring sun. The last time I was at Parade Grounds I was at football practice that had went from a team of twenty players that everyone would go to practice and give their all for, to a team of twenty players where only five players were “available.” And before all this my smooth brained mind thought I wanted to play baseball. In another part of Prospect Park with wide open fields with ten teams playing on their own little baseballs pitches (I was in second grade).
